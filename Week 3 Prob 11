"""
We want to write some simple procedures that work on dictionaries to return information.

This time, write a procedure, called biggest, which returns the key corresponding to the entry with the largest number of values associated with it. If there is more than one such entry, return any one of the matching keys.
"""


#to answer this i wrote a function that took the length of the values for each key and created a new dictionary(d) of {original key:number of values}, then used found the maximum value and used key=(value).get to return the key.
